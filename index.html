                    <p>Getting to the top is no straight line. Rhodes' one is the one that's more Zigged and Zagged than anyone else. His story is one that shows believing in yourself, knowing what your worth, and fighting for what you believe in can pay off extraordinary dividends.</p>
                    <p>Stories are their best when they mirror the human experience. Even in professional wrestling we gravitate towards storys that we can relate to. Whether it's stone colds triumph over every obstacle his Tyrant boss threw in his way. </p>
                    <p>Or a story like Daniel Bryan who's hard work and connection to the fans forced his way into the main events at WrestleMania even though the company did not see him more than a B grade wrestler.</p>
                    <p>Cody Rhodes the son of Dusty Rhodes who was actually a very important character in WWE history mainly because of his connection to the fans, emotional skills, and excellent promos was regarded as one of the great. Dusty introduced Cody into the WWE in 2007 where he debuted to defend his dad from Randy Orton.</p>
                    <p>During this time, Cody Rhodes had small cameos of different characters. For instance he had a faction with Ted Dibiase Junior followed by the Dashing Cody Rhodes gimmick. Right after this Rey Mysterio broke his nose which led to his another gimmick where he started putting paperbacks on his opponents face. This phase was promising, he had great promos and eventually won the intercontinental championship. Moreover the stardust gimmick included wearing face paint and a full body suit. This was a shocking one, but he did it as a tribute to his brother. And this gimmick was not working. Cody and Goldust created a feud which they wanted to take it till WrestleMania but that didn't work either. Things were not going in his way as he asked the story writers to remove him from the stardust gimmick. In 2015 Dusty Rhodes past away and in the following year Cody asked WWE to terminate his contract.</p>
                    <p>He went Impact wrestling (also known as TNA). This place was also run by former WWE. Wrestlers like Drew McIntyre and Bobby Lashley. Both of them came back as bigger stars. Cody here was working with building a new character - The American Nightmare.
                    <p>Cody won the NWA championship in 2017 and that night Tony kha was present and he asked Cody about AEW (a new wrestling franchise) hence AEW was born. And Cody was not just a face in the ring he was the vice president. They also signed some ex WWE stars like Chris Jericho. Here the match at double or nothing was Cody vs Goldust the same match WWE couldn't see as WrestleMania worthy. In 2022 he lost his title and also after some disagreements with Tony khah, Cody left AEW.</p>
                    <p>In 2022 he returned to WWE and this is where the story got special. This was a tricky move because WWE owners are notoriously known for changing the gimmicks of the wrestlers who leave the company and come back, however Cody's situation was unchanged.
                        Coming back he fought with Seth Rollins with a pec injury and later also participated in the royal rumble which he ended up winning. After all these Cody deserved a shot at the WWE championship. </p>
                        <p>However, he lost that match. And interestingly in the post match show Triple H said that in wrestling the story must go on. This was followed by a beef with the beast incarnate Brock Lesnar, which Cody won with high spirits and Brock went off script to give him the green light to go and finish the story. It may seem the story is gonna be straightforward now but roman reigns was actually supposed to fight his Cousin The Rock at the WrestleMania, but he got the shot deserved as the winner of the Royal Rumble.In WrestleMania 40 Cody fought The Rock and Roman Reigns and stood tall. </p>
                        <p>And we can all relate to Cody the idea of being stuck where we are, feeling like we deserve more but Cody did the hardest thing he possibly could, which is he left the comfort and the security of WWE, worked on himself, worked his ass off all over the world and came back a bigger star than anyone</p>

            <h2>Digital Addiction: A Tragedy of the Modern Day</h2>

                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>Ever since Mahin was an infant, he had an attachment to all kinds of devices. As a baby, whenever he began to have one of those temper tantrums for attention, his mother would hand him a tablet, and instantly, all the crying would stop. Little did anyone know, this early screen time would set the stage for something much deeper.</p>
                    <p>Video after more entertaining video, each one drawing his attention until his mom would utter the words, "Mahin, playtime is over." But inevitably, after throwing a fit, here comes the tablet again. By the time he was nine, Jeffrey was hooked on devices. His father gave him an iPhone he had been begging for. In his free time, he watched hours of anime along with videos on TikTok. And socially, he shut down: He barely interacted with classmates, his grades began to fall, and teachers warned his parents. "He is always tired and never does his homework.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, a few years later, it seemed as though things would only get worse for Mahin at college.</p>
                    <p>Unable to discipline himself to study, he spent more time playing games and thumbing his phone than he attended class. Predictably, he dropped out. Depressed, he went home to parents who berated him as a "loser" who would amount to nothing. Angry at the world-and himself-Mahin retreated into even more video games and social media. For years, he shut himself off from the world.</p>
                    <p>In his self-imposed isolation, Mahin felt that on Instagram, former classmates were thriving and moving ahead in life, though he himself felt like he was stuck. He dived into games, desperately, never to understand the reality of his predicament.</p>
                    <p>The Age of Digital Addiction It is an extreme story, but most have encountered similar experiences. In fact, the average American spends over three hours per day on their device, checking their phone upwards of 60 times daily. Most of that time is spent on social media, obsessively scrolling endlessly. Why do we feel the need to check for updates or messages?</p>
                    <p>It has to do with the design of our gadgets. These platforms are designed by behavioral scientists and psychologists to keep us hooked. Why? They want to seize our time, which is the most valuable resource we own. The Science behind the Addiction Enter B.F. Skinner, Harvard University psychology professor. In 1938 he introduced the world to the variable reward schedule in his book, "The Behavior of Organisms". Skinner built a device called the 'Skinner Box',</p>

            <h2>Taking an Aim, Even If It’s Bad: Insights from Jordan Peterson</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="excerpt">Jordan Peterson, a renowned clinical psychologist and professor. His idea of setting goals revolves around the concept that setting goals, no matter how small or inaccurate they may be, is essential for personal growth, fulfillment, and navigating life’s complexities.</p>

                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>Jordan Peterson, a renowned clinical psychologist and professor. His idea of setting goals revolves around the concept that setting goals, no matter how small or inaccurate they may be, is essential for personal growth, fulfillment, and navigating life’s complexities.</p>
                    <p>The Necessity of Aim: Why You Need a Target</p>
                    <p>Peterson frequently draws on psychological and philosophical principles to argue that human beings need an aim to give their lives structure and direction. Without an aim, people lack order and may drift here and there, and overwhelmed by the complexities and challenges of life. He emphasizes that having a clear or a small goal, no matter how imperfect, gives you something to work toward, a reason to get up in the morning, and a framework for making decisions.</p>
                    <p>One of his most famous line is, “You cannot hit a target if you don’t aim for it.” The focus here is that the aim doesn’t have to be final. What matters is that atleast you are aiming at something. It is better to aim badly than to not aim at all, because an aim provides direction—it allows you to move forward, make progress and eventually go forward. </p>
                    <p>The Fear of a Bad Aim: Perfectionism and Paralysis</p>
                    <p>Many people are resistant or lack the enthusiasm to take an aim because they fear making the wrong choice or setting a goal that isn’t perfect. This is where perfectionism becomes a trap. The fear of setting a bad aim often leads to inaction, as individuals passively wait for the “perfect” target to appear before they begin. According to Jordan Peterson, this is a mistake.</p>
                    <p>Perfection is an impossible idea, and waiting for the perfect aim before you act will only lead to stagnation and more misery in our current state. Aiming at something, even if it's not the ideal goal, gives you a reference point from which you can adjust and improve. Through experience and feedback, you can adjust and improve your aim and move closer to your desired goal.</p>
                    <p>Peterson explains, "You’re not going to be any good at it, but you’ll get better at it." The key is to start where you are, with whatever resources and knowledge you have. Over time, you can course-correct, but only if you’re moving forward.</p>
                    <p>The Value of Failure: Learning and Adjustment</p>
                    <p>Failure is a form of feedback, and without it, you don’t have a way of knowing what, how, and where to adjust your actions. By taking aim, you invite feedback into your life, allowing you to grow and refine your path.</p>
                    <p>The Process of Iteration: Constantly Improving Your Aim</p>
                    <p>Peterson says that life is a constant process of iteration—setting aims, missing, adjusting, and refining. Nobody starts with a perfect shot, and that's okay. Whats important is to engage in the process of aiming and adjusting. Over time, through trial and error, your aim will improve.</p>
                    <p>Aiming, even badly, helps you move toward something meaningful, this requires courage. It means confronting the uncertainty of life. Avoiding aim out of fear is not a solution.</p>

            <h2>The Story of Pinocchio: More Than a Children’s Tale</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="excerpt">It is an unpredictable story about a wooden puppet called Pinocchio, created by a craftsman called Geppetto who wanted a son.

                <p></p>
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>This is the full content of the second writing piece. It can contain all the details and length you need.</p>
                    <p>It is an unpredictable story about a wooden puppet called Pinocchio, created by a craftsman called Geppetto who wanted a son. To become a real boy, however, he must be baptized into another world, which teaches him to be deemed responsible no matter how hard it is. Pinocchio was made to take this journey filled with failures, temptations, and hard-won wisdom, which takes a lot of endurance and faith. For Jordan Peterson, Pinocchio is what he calls a transforming gnome who must accept adulthood and the responsibilities of their life. The movie is not just about a wooden doll turning into a human being; it is, much, about the transition from adolescence to adulthood .</p>
                    <p>The Archetypal Journey: Becoming Real</p>
                    <p>The key point of this approach is that the journey Pinocchio takes is best understood as the quest of every archetypal hero, a theme developed by Joseph Campbell and further by Carl Jung.</p>
                    <p>In Pinocchio, this journey is marked by several key moments that Peterson emphasizes.

                        Geppetto’s Wish: Geppetto wish for his puppet son Pinocchio to transform into a real boy cannot be seen merely as a wish of a father for his son. The hope that his full potential would actualize one day. It is indeed every parent that desires this change. However, a complete transformation is not easy, it involves hard work, persistence and accepting the harsh realities.
                        </p>
                    <p>Jiminy Cricket as the Conscience: As the conscience, Jiminy also acts as the moral compass to which all moral decisions also called choices Pinocchio has, must follow and that guides Pinocchio also. Peterson For development to occur, that voice must be attended to, that voice that speaks in the inner ear when one is going headstrong in accountability and truth.</p>
                    <p>The Temptation of Pleasure Island: A very important lesson in the story is the one when Pinocchio is taken to pleasure island—a place where boys want to go willingly because it is lawless and boys can have whatever pleasures they want. However, if they do so, they are turned into donkeys which in their case illustrate the consequences of having a pleasure driven society; the people are brought down from the greatness of being humans. For Peterson, this serves not only as an effective description of debauchery but the pursuit of pleasure and self-gratification as a way of life.</p>
                    <p>Responsibility: The Way to be of Worth</p>
                    <p>Essentially, Pinocchio is about the becoming real. Peterson links it with the act of growing up to be responsible. The wooden puppet through which Pinocchio takes the initial state represents the state of childishness, naivety and irresponsibility. He is driven by impulse, chaotic, and lacks direction.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Pinocchio learning to take on more responsibility for his actions, which brings him one step closer to being a real child. He understands the importance of truthfulness, bravery as well as selflessness. He only earns his place among other humans the moment he takes the risk on his own life in order to save Geppetto.</p>
                    <p>Telling the Truth and Reformation</p>
                    <p>‘Do not lie, or what is more, do not lie in a way that is detectable.’ These stand out as some of Peterson's rules for living. Lying holds a prominent place in Pinocchio as well. Pinocchio’s nose extends every time he tells a lie. And each of this serves as a lesson – Lying whether to oneself or to others is always a perversion that hinders progress.</p>

            <h2>Why there is a lack of interest in retail investments in Bangladesh</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="excerpt">There are only 2 million B.O accounts from a population of 171 million which is only 3.42% of the population in the country, as of may 2022. The underlying factors for this market deficiency, manipulation, and psychological factors.</p>
    
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>In contrast with neighboring nation like India the figure stands at 11.43% of the populations, we are quite below the threshold.</p>
                <p>On the other hand in highly developed countries like the USA the dynamic is quite different. Large portion of the investors are attracted to the market through complex derivative products such as options and futures. Additionally psychological factors such as the fear of missing out leads people to invest in meme stocks such as GME and AMC, which have returns over 20 times in less than 2 months. In the absence of these the market may diminish attraction. The retail traders are approximately 50% of the population. This figure derives from multiple platform users such as robinhood, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, etc. In both the countries the concept of BO account is not common rather they work directly with the brokerages.</p>
                <p>In that regard Bangladeshi people are also very risk aversive. Risk-averse options are very popular in the country, these are called savings certificates, also known as Sanchayapatra that promises a return every 3 months or a return on investment every 5 years . And the high rates on these investments lures the investors away from exploring other options. Lets use this analogy: if your ever at an amusement park and the thrilling rides such as the roller coasters are empty and everyone is riding the kitty rides, this diminishes the spirit of the amusement park and so the same happens in the world of investments.</p>
                <p>Moreover, multiple corruption cases and regulatory problems, and a lack of financial literacy exists which needs to be addressed.</p>
